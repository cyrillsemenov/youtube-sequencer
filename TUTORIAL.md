Hello everyone! Today, I'm going to show you how to install a YouTube sequencer, while it's not yet in the Chrome Web Store. This extension is not only fun to use but also open for customization and contribution.

# Downloading the Tool

First, go to the GitHub page linked in the description. Look for a green button labeled 'Code.' Click on it and choose 'Download ZIP' from the dropdown menu. Once the download is complete, unzip the file to a familiar location on your computer.

# Setting Up in Chrome

Now, return to your browser. In the address bar, type 'chrome://extensions' and press Enter. This takes you to the extensions page.

# Enabling Developer Mode

In the top-right corner, you'll find a toggle for 'Developer mode.' Turn this on. Developer mode allows the installation of custom extensions not available in the Chrome Web Store.

# Installing the Extension

With Developer mode on, you'll see new options. Click 'Load unpacked' in the top-left corner. A file dialog will appear. Navigate to where you unzipped the file and select the folder. This installs the sequencer extension in Chrome.

# Using the Sequencer on YouTube

Head over to YouTube and choose any video. For instance, start with this one since you're already here. You should see the new sequencer interface. If it's not visible, refresh the page.

# Exploring Sequencer Features

Here's what you can do with the sequencer:
* Change the video's tempo.
* Create a new step by specifying slice number, speed, and note length.
* Modify or delete steps live, and control playback with play, pause, stop, and clear functions.
Let's understand what a 'slice' is. If a YouTube video is 10 seconds long, pressing a number key from zero to one jumps to a corresponding second. Essentially, you're moving to a point calculated as the number you press times the video length divided by ten. Experiment with this – it's quite fun!
Regarding speed, while YouTube's player allows adjustments from a quarter to double the original speed, the sequencer offers precision control ranging from 0.0625 times to 16 times the original speed. I’ve mapped this to a value range from 0 to 100 for ease of use, where 50 is the original speed, 100 is 16 times faster, and 0 is 16 times slower.

Closing Remarks

I have many ideas to further enhance this sequencer, so stay tuned for updates.
